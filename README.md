## Install

Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/AaronSaikovski/go-api-starte/generate) button at the top of this project's GitHub page to get started.

## Usage

### Setup configuration

1. Configure the `go.mod` file and replace `module github.com/AaronSaikovski/go-api-starter` with your specific project url.
2. Configure the `Makefile` targets and parameters
3. Update the name in the `LICENSE` or swap it out entirely
4. Configure the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file
5. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with your own info
6. Rename other files/folders as needed and configure their content
7. Delete this `README` and rename `README_project.md` to `README.md`
8. Run `go mod tidy` to ensure all the modules and packages are in place.
9. The build process is run from the `Makefile` and to test the project is working type: `make run` and check the console for output.

### Build and run

#### run `make help` for more assistance on the make file.

```
help          - Display help about make targets for this Makefile
localrelease  - Builds the project in preparation for (local)release
docs          - updates the swagger docs
debug         - Builds the project in preparation for debug
buildandrun   - builds and runs the program on the target platform
run           - runs main.go for testing
clean         - Remove the old builds and any debug information
unittest      - executes unit tests
dep           - fetches any external dependencies
vet           - Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs
staticcheck   - Runs static code analyzer staticcheck - currently broken
seccheck      - Code vulnerability check
lint          - format code and tidy modules
depupdate     - Update dependencies
```

### Docker Support

This project has been fully tested with Docker and includes a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file and uses a multi-stage docker file to reduce the docker image to approx. 30MB.
The docker build process also optimises the Go executable down to a bare minimum.
To build the docker image type:

```
docker build -t golangapi:1.0.0 .
```

and to run the comtainer type:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 golangapigolangapi:1.0.0
```

or you can streamline the container build and run process by typing:

```
docker compose up
```

and to tear it down type:

```
docker compose down
```
